# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases my journey as an aspiring Front-End Developer, my skills, and the projects Iâ€™ve been working on. The design is focused on clarity, responsiveness, and a smooth user experience.

## Overview

The portfolio includes sections for my introduction, background, skills, projects, and contact details. It features smooth animations, responsive design, and a fixed navigation bar that highlights the section currently in view. The layout is built with clean, semantic HTML and modern CSS styling.

## Features

- Responsive layout that adapts to all screen sizes  
- Fixed navigation bar with active link highlighting  
- Smooth scrolling and fade-in animations for a modern look  
- Section-based structure: Home, About, Skills, Projects, and Contact  
- Reusable CSS components and clear organization  
- Contact links for email, LinkedIn, and GitHub  

## Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, gradients, animations, media queries)  
- JavaScript (scroll effects and dynamic navigation)  

## What I Learned

Building this portfolio helped me improve in several key areas:
- Structuring a multipage-style layout within a single-page application  
- Using JavaScript for interactivity and scroll-based effects  
- Writing clean, maintainable CSS with reusable variables and consistent spacing  
- Making design decisions focused on readability and user experience  

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed project pages or live links  
- Integrate a contact form with JavaScript or backend service  
- Improve accessibility with ARIA roles and labels  
- Add dark/light mode toggle
